This script creates FULL Backup of MySQL DB and Linux Server related DATA files.
We can adjust it to do incremental basis backup too, but I based on my personnel experiences, I prefer to have FULL backup instead of incremental,
Because you never know what you will going to need in case of disaster recovery
Adjust below DATA fields accordingly. remove / add desired folders.
